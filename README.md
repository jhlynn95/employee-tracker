# Employee-tracker
# Description
## Employee Tracker application using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
## For this assignment I was tasked with creating a command-line application from scratch as there is not starter code. This is an interface that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with the information stored in the databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS).

## Installation

-Copy repository code and run git clone command on your your machine.

-Install npm packages by running npm install or npm run install

-Open integrated command line in db folder and run mysql -u root -p followed by source schema.sql then source seeds.sql after so type exit

-cd into server.js file and then run node index.js on the command line
